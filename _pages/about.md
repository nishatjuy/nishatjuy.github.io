I am a Research Associate at [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/), with prior experience as a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), where I spent three years contributing to experimental and quasi-experimental studies in education, employment, local environmental risks, and healthcare. I also served as a Consultant at the NGO Forum for Public Health, managing data flow and implementing randomized control trials.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh. Currently, I am a non-degree student at Columbia University in the City of New York. Growing up in an underdeveloped community inspired me to address socio-economic challenges, and my research interests include labor economics, weak state capacity, and poverty alleviation.
