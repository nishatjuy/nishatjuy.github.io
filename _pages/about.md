I am a Research Associate at [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, with prior experience as a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), where I spent three years contributing to experimental and quasi-experimental studies in education, employment, local environmental risks, and healthcare. I also served as a Consultant at the NGO Forum for Public Health, managing data flow and implementing randomized control trials.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh. Currently, I am a non-degree student at Columbia University in the City of New York. Growing up in an underdeveloped community inspired me to address socio-economic challenges, and my research interests include Development, Labor, Environmental, and Micro Economics.

Research Interest
------
I aspire to pursue a PhD program to advance my research in Economics and Public Policy. My objective is to develop evidence-based solutions to address critical global challenges, with a focus on economic development, governance, and poverty alleviation.
